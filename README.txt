The program allows users to create todo lists and save them as json files. It is posiible to search a given directory (line 17 in todoList.py) and import different tasks lists.

To run a file you have to download the directory 'tasks_lists' and todoList.py file. 
In the directory 'tasks_lists' there are files with already created tasks.
Run todoList.py usieng IDE.
In the file change folderPath on line 17 to match the location of the directory 'tasks_lists' you already downloaded.
Run the program and create todo tasks :)
